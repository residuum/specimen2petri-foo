XSL stylesheets for converting sample banks from specimen[0] format to
the format used by its fork and designated successor petri-foo[1].

There are two different versions for different locale settings, depending
on whether your locale settings uses comma or dot as decimal separator:

s2p_comma.xsl
s2p_dot.xsl

Part of the conversion is possible right now, but the converted files
are not yet loadable.

You will need a tool to transform the specimen XML to the new format,
e. g. xsltproc[2] works for this:

$ xsltproc s2p_dot.xsl specimen_file > converted_file
